# Cloned from: The Data Visualization Society
This repo is meant to store products (like data-driven badges for our members) or datasets related to the [Data Visualization Society](https://datavisualizationsociety.com).

This is my first forked and cloned repo.


## Directories
I am trying to stick to the [R project orgization style](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/), which should help to make this more portable.
